Dr. Nguyễn Tùng Anh's research lies at the intersection of **federated learning**, **optimization**, and **machine learning**, with a strong focus on privacy-preserving and distributed AI systems. He has contributed significantly to topics such as **federated PCA on Grassmann manifolds** for anomaly detection in IoT networks, **robust federated learning** under distribution shifts, and **spatio-temporal data modeling** for large-scale systems.

His work has appeared in top-tier venues, including **IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking**, **IEEE INFOCOM**, and **SIAM SDM**, addressing challenges in **efficient model personalization**, **large-scale multivariate time-series anomaly detection**, and **federated deep equilibrium learning**. He has collaborated extensively with researchers from The University of Sydney, Korea University, and international partners, and his research has been cited more than **60 times** since 2020.

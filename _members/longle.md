Dr. Long Tan Le' s research interests span **federated learning**, **data mining**, **edge AI**, and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. His work focuses on designing **robust and efficient distributed learning systems** for resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments.

He has made notable contributions to **federated PCA on Grassmann manifolds** for IoT anomaly detection, **distributionally robust federated learning** for mobile edge networks, and **federated deep equilibrium learning** for enhanced personalization. His research also addresses practical challenges in **security for SDN-enabled networks**, **real-time edge-based applications** such as parking occupancy detection, and **hardware acceleration using FPGA** for intrusion detection systems.

His publications appear in leading venues such as **IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking**, **IEEE INFOCOM**, and **Mobile Networks and Applications**, and his collaborations extend across academia and industry to bring theoretical advances into real-world deployment.

Wen Li is currently pursuing a Master of Data Science at the University of Sydney. Her research interests center on making large language models more reliable and trustworthy, including **hallucination mitigation**, **evaluation and uncertainty estimation**, **controllable text generation**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. She is also interested in methods that improve model efficiency and safety for practical deployment, particularly with **small/efficient language models**.
